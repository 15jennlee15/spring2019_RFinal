### What's a Function?

What is a function? Very simply, a function is a block of reusable code that is used to perform an action. 

In R, we can store a function as an object and thus be able to recall the function repeatedly and perform an operation (or several) very quickly and easily with a single command.  Let's break it down a little bit more.

Here's an example of a function

```{r Example Function, echo=TRUE}
mean_function <- function(variable) {
  mean(variable)
}

```
First by using the "<-" we are assigning the function to an object name.  Note that the name of the function is meaningful, that is, we can guess what it does by it's name. This is important if you create a lot of functions, as you may loose track of the purpose of each. Furthermore, it helps make your code more readable to others.

Our example function is very simple, it calculates the mean of a variable.  Now, we could just do this with mean(variable), but I wanted to use a simple example for our first function. The input to this function would be a variable, the output would be the mean of that variable.  You can test this example function by entering different variables from our dataset.

Next, a function is composed of three parts:

1) *Body*: this is the code inside the function (inside the curly brackets {}).
    In our example, the 'body' is the part within the curly brackets, in this case:  mean(variable).
    
2) *Formals*: these are the arguements supplied to the function - controls how we can call the function
    In our example, the formal, the arguement we supply to the function, is 'variable'. The formals are listed in       the parantheses right after function.  Your function can have multiple formals. 
    
   So for example, let's say we wanted to have a function that calculates the mean of two variables.  In this           case, we'd need to provide two formals, variable 1 and variable 2 (see example below).  Note that you can call      the formals whatever you want. In this case we used 'variable1' and 'variable2'. We could have also used 'x' and     'y', 'cat' and 'dog', anything really. The names are arbitrary, but it is most helpful to give the formals names     that are meaninful so you can remember what type of information you need to provide it. 
    
```{r Second Example Function with Two Formals, echo=TRUE}
mean_function2 <- function(variable1, variable2) {
  (mean(variable1) + mean(variable2))/2
}
```
3) *Environment*:  the "map" of the location of the function's variables - where it lives. How the function finds       the values assoiciated with the names.  While you explicitly state the body and formals, the environment is         implicitly specified based on where the function was defined.

Let's try out our functions using our movie dataset (link to download above) which I named 'data'. First let's try out the 'mean_function'.  You can supply the function with a variable and it should output the mean. Let's try it out.

```{r Trying Functions Out, echo =TRUE}
#Here's our function
mean_function <- function(variable) {
  mean(variable)
}

#What is the average imdb score for the films in our dataset?
mean_function(data$imdb_score)
```
We called the function using the name we assigned it, supplied the input(our variable), and received the output (our mean) of 6.44!

Hooray!

Let's try another.  Let's find out what the average film duration is.

```{r Tryout Functions Number 2, echo=TRUE, error=TRUE}
mean_function(data$duration)

```
Uh oh! Our result was NA? Why do you think that happened?

When we look at our dataframe, we see that the variable 'duration' does have missing data.  We need to remove that to get our function to work.  To do that, let's just add it to our function!

```{r Function Remove missing Data, echo=TRUE}
#Let's write over our previous 'mean_function' to remove missing data so it works on more of our variables
mean_function <- function(variable) {
  mean(variable, na.rm=TRUE)
}

#Now let's try to find out the average film duration again
mean_function(data$duration)
```
Great it worked!  The average film duration is 107 minutes.

Now let's try out our second function. Let's combine the number of facebook likes for actor1 and actor2 and see what the overall average is. But first, let's modify the function to remove missing data.

```{r Testing Out Function 2 Average Number of Facebook Likes, echo=TRUE}
#modify the function to exclude missing data
mean_function2 <- function(variable1, variable2) {
  (mean(variable1, na.rm=TRUE) + mean(variable2, na.rm=TRUE))/2
}

#Remember we have to provide two variables for our second function
mean_function2(data$actor_1_facebook_likes, data$actor_2_facebook_likes)

```
The average number of facebook likes is 4,105! Great job!

### Custom Functions

Now that you have some basic function knowledge, let's take a try at creating some more complex functions.  Let's first try to make a function that is very specific to this dataset.  Let's try something fun.  Let's write a function that will tell us the average imdb score for a given actor!

```{r Custom Function 1, echo=TRUE}
#We first want to pick a meaningful name for our function, so it is clear what it does.  Also what's the arguements we need to provide to the function?  The actor's name right?  So we'll have one formal for this function.
average_imdb <- function(actor) {
  #Now the dataset in it's current form isn't ideal for this question, but luckily we can change the dataset within   the function.  Notice that nothing is saved to our global environment when we do this, it remains in the function.
  
  #There are three columns of actors in the dataset - actor1, 2, and 3.  We will want to gather these all into one      column first. I also used select here to select just the relevant variables
  df <- data %>%
    select(actor_1_name, actor_2_name, actor_3_name, imdb_score) %>%
    gather(number, actor, -imdb_score )
  #Next, we want to aggregate the data such that when there are multiple instances of an actor, we calculate their overall mean
    df <- aggregate(imdb_score ~ actor, df, mean)
 #Next, so that we can call up the actor, we give the rows names of the actors.
  row.names(df) <- df$actor 
 #Lastly, we call up the imdb score for the given actor
 df[actor,"imdb_score"]
    }

#And that's our function. So you can see it more clearly, here it is written out without the comments:
average_imdb <- function(actor) {
  df <- data %>%
    select(actor_1_name, actor_2_name, actor_3_name, imdb_score) %>%
    gather(number, actor, -imdb_score )
  
  df <- aggregate(imdb_score ~ actor, df, mean)
  row.names(df) <- df$actor 
  
 df[actor,"imdb_score"]
    }

```

Now let's try the function out!

```{r Trying out Actor Function, echo=TRUE}

average_imdb("Tom Cruise")
average_imdb("Johnny Depp")
average_imdb("Will Smith")

```

Great! This worked, it reported the average imdb for each actor input we gave it.  

Now, what if I misspelled an actor's name, what would the function do then?  Let's try it.

```{r Misspelled Name, echo=TRUE, error=TRUE}

average_imdb("tom cruz")
```
The function returned 'NA'.  This makes sense given that there isn't a 'tom cruz' in our list, but that may not be clear to the user of our function.  One thing we can do to make our function even more effective is to add helpful messages, warnings, and errors. Let's try adding a more descriptive return message to our average imdb function when we receive 'NA'.

```{r Helpful Return Messages, echo=TRUE}
average_imdb <- function(actor) {
  df <- data %>%
    select(actor_1_name, actor_2_name, actor_3_name, imdb_score) %>%
    gather(number, actor, -imdb_score )
  
  df <- aggregate(imdb_score ~ actor, df, mean)
  row.names(df) <- df$actor 
  
 name <- df[actor,"imdb_score"]
 #We can add 'if' statements to our functions to add conditions to our function. See more below.
 if(is.na(name)) {
    return("This actor is not in our database.  Did you check your spelling?  Make sure to capitalize the first letter of the first and last name")
 }
 else {
   return(name)
 }

}

average_imdb("Tom Crude")

```

This time we receive not 'NA' but a helpful message that tells us that our name is not in the database or that we misspelled it. 

### IF Statements

In the previous case, we included a conditional return message, but you can also provide custom messages, warnings, and errors. To create a custom error, you will enter the conditional information, and use 'stop' instead or 'return'.  Stop 'stops' the function and outputs the error.

if(what is the condition) {
  stop("Error Message)
}

Warning is very similar, except you'd use 'warning' instead or 'stop'. In this case the function won't stop running, put will provide the output as well as the error message.

if(conditional statement) {
  warning("warning message")
}

We do this by adding 'If' statements within our function.  If statements provide conditions through which the function operates differentially given certain circumstances.  In the case above, we created an 'If' statement that was based on the output we received.  You could also create 'If' statements that affect how the input is dealt with. For example:

```{r Example If Statement for Input, echo=TRUE}
Input_if <- function(number) {
  if(number >= 0) {
    number * 5
  }
  if(number < 0) {
    abs(number) * 5
  }
}

#Try it out
Input_if(4)

Input_if(-4)

```
In our example function above, we used 'if' statements to make it so the function performed differently if the input(a number) was greater than or less than 0.  

You can use as many 'if' statements as you'd like in a function. You can also use 'else' if you want the function to perform one way for a given condition but respond another way given any other input that doesn't match that condition. For example, instead of using two 'if' statements in our function above, we could have used 'else'.

```{r Example Statement with Else, echo=TRUE}
Input_if <- function(number) {
  if(number >= 0) {
    number * 5
  }
  else {
    abs(number) * 5
  }
}

#Try it out
Input_if(4)

Input_if(-4)

```

### More on Custom Functions

Our 'average_imdb' function was fun and worked efficiently, however, that function would only be relevant to that particular dataset.  Let's make a function that is more generalizable and could be used with any dataset.

Let's make a function that outputs descriptives for a given variable.  This is useful and can be used with any dataset that has a numerical variable.  To make the function effective, we should include a meaningful name, useful error messages, and make it generalizable to any dataset.

First, we want to think about what descriptives we want the function to output.  Let's go with some standards:  mean, standard deviation, minimum value, maximum value, total number of observations, and number of missing data points.

We will also want to make sure to account for missing data.

Let's give it a try.

```{r Custom Function 2, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE}

descriptives <- function(variable) {
  
  if(!is.numeric(variable)) {
      stop("Variable supplied is not numeric!", call. = FALSE)
  }
     
  data.frame(mean = mean(variable, na.rm = TRUE), 
             std_dev = sd(variable, na.rm = TRUE),
             min_value = min(variable, na.rm = TRUE),
             max_value = max(variable, na.rm = TRUE),
             total_n = length(variable), 
             missing_data = sum(is.na(variable))) 
    }

#Test if it works
descriptives(data$imdb_score)

#Let's make sure our error message works too
descriptives(data$color)
```
Great! Our function works as expected and it correctly delivers a useful error message!
